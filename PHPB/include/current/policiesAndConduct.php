                      <p>Students admitted to UF’s PHPB Program are committing to and are accountable to the requirements and expectation of the PHPB program.  PHPB is a holistic, full time (15-18 credits per semester) program that includes required prerequisite courses for health professional graduate programs and entrance exam preparation as well as courses for professional development in preparation for interviews and admission. This is an intensive, five semester program for career changers.</p>
                      <p>Students do have opportunities for adding selected electives.</p>
                      <p>UF PHPB does not offer all prerequisite courses for all healthcare professions. Students might need to take additional courses after completion of PHPB. APK2100C, APK2105C and MCB3020/L are not offered via PHPB.</p>
                      <h4>PHPB students:</h4>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Make consistent progress in PHPB by taking the courses in the sequence as offered and carrying rigorous, full time course loads of 15-18 credits in fall and spring semesters.</li>

                        <li>Because admission to healthcare graduate programs is extremely competitive, students are expected to complete all courses with a minimum of a C or above and maintain a minimum science and cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or that which is competitive for the profession student is applying to. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) applicants admitted to medical schools have a mean GPA of 3.67 in science courses.</li>

                        <li>Admission to professional healthcare graduate programs requires ongoing and consistent participation in extra-curricular activities. By the end of the first semester, students will present an all-inclusive professional development plan to be pursued while in PHPB. This plan will include but not be limited to: research, healthcare clinical volunteering or employment, community service, shadowing and demonstration of competencies/characteristics as outlined at: <a href="https://www.advising.ufl.edu/docs/AAMCCoreCompetencies.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.advising.ufl.edu/docs/AAMCCoreCompetencies.pdf</a> Students will review and evaluate plans each semester with the PHPB coordinator.</li>

                        <li>Pursuing admission to professional graduate programs requires your sincere and genuine commitment to ongoing and in-depth professional development. Students in the program will be evaluated against the highest standards in participation in all academic and professional development activities. <u>Participation in PHPB Professional Development groups is required</u>.</li>

                        <li>Maintain consistent class attendance.  Students with frequent or recurrent unexcused absences may not be allowed to continue in PHPB.</li>

                        <li>Earn a 3.0 or above in all semesters.</li>

                        <li>Cannot be dually enrolled in another institution while a student in PHPB.</li>

                        <li><u>Dropping or Withdrawing from courses</u>: Due to the sequential nature of academic requirements, dropping a required course or doing a full semester withdrawal may impact your ability to continue in the program.</li>

                        <p>If you wish to do a full semester withdrawal or drop a single course, you are required to speak with a PHPB advisor for approval and to review the impacts of withdrawing on your ability to complete the program. The PHPB advisor will drop you from individual courses or review the process for a full semester withdrawal. Withdrawal from courses will be reviewed on a case by case basis for continued status in PHPB.</p>
                        <p>PHPB students may withdraw from a maximum of one science or two non-science courses while in the PHPB program. If you require more drops you may petition the PHPB Administrative Committee with extenuating circumstances. Retroactive course withdrawals are done through the University Student Petitions Committee process found at: <a href="http://www.registrar.ufl.edu/currents/petitioninstructs.html" target="_blank">http://www.registrar.ufl.edu/currents/petitioninstructs.html</a></p>

                        <li>Leave of Absence: A leave of absence is not an option due to the sequential nature of the curriculum.</li>

                        <li>“I” or Incomplete Grades: Incompletes in any course need to be resolved by the end of the next term of enrollment.</li>

                        <li><u>Registration</u>:  Each semester you will be registered for courses by PHPB administrative coordinators.</li>
                      </ol>

                       <h4>Petitioning PHPB policies:</h4>
                       <p>If you have extenuating circumstances and wish to be considered for an exception to any of these academic policies, you may submit a petition to the PHPB Administrative Committee for consideration. Meet with a PHPB advisor promptly to obtain the necessary paperwork and instructions</p>
