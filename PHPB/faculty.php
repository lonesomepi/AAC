        <p><b>Bobbi Knickerbocker</b><br><i>Director PHPB</i></p>
        <p>Prior to coming to the University of Florida (UF) in 2008, I worked in healthcare as both an R.N. and hospice chaplain. While most of my healthcare experience was in general pediatrics, the last fifteen years were spent working in pediatric and adult hospice. I also had the privilege of working with both the Oglala Lakota tribe in South Dakota, providing educational and daily living needs, and the Roma population coordinating and providing medical clinics in northwest villages of Romania in cooperation with Romanian healthcare providers. In addition to my R.N. and B.A. in Family Education, I completed a Masters in Religious Education from Western Theological Seminary and a Masters in Counseling from Central Michigan University.</p>
        <p>I have been with UF for over ten years providing advising for students in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, in the Biology, Botany and Zoology majors, as well as pre-health students university wide who seek advising as they build their applications towards admission to healthcare professional schools. I am director of the Pre-Health Post-Bac (PHPB) program and teach the PHPB Seminar.</p>
        <p>I serve on the UF College of Medicine Committee on Diversity.  And I serve as a board member for both the National Association of Advisors for the Health Professions (NAAHP) and the Southeastern Association of Advisors for the Health Professions (SAAHP).  I worked with other advisors to bring the Committee of Diversity and Inclusion (CDI) to both the national and regional levels.</p>
        <p>I am committed to and passionate about empowering and guiding students in their preparation for professional healthcare careers and the privilege in sharing their journeys.</p>
