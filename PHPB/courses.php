        <h2>Course Information</h2>
        <p>PHPB is a structured two-year program. Most courses are taken in sections just for students in the PHPB cohort.  Courses are offered once per year.</p>
        <p>Students in PHPB are expected to take rigorous courses loads of 15 credits per semester to demonstrate the ability to do the course loads required in healthcare professional schools.</p>
        <p>There are additional required courses unique to PHPB to assist with gaining knowledge and skills required for professional preparation. All students in PHPB are required to take these courses.</p>


        <p>Once admitted, an individualized academic plan will be completed for each student taking into account previously completed courses.</p>
        <p>All courses five or more years old or with less than a B earned must be retaken.</p>
        <p><b><u>If there are other courses required for a professional school that are not part of the PHPB curriculum, these may be taken following completion of PHPB.  There is no guarantee of taking these courses at UF.</u></b></p>

          <p class="quoteSlug">The University of Floridaâ€™s PHPB program allowed me achieve my goal of attending medical school. As a Career Changer, the streamlined curriculum made it easy to complete the necessary prerequisites in a timely and cost-efficient manner. With the help of knowledgeable professors, along with the provided tutoring and testing resources, I was able to score in the 99th percentile on the MCAT. Furthermore, advisor support and professional development workshops helped me grow into a well-rounded, and competitive applicant. The PHPB program provided the foundation on which I will build my medical career for years to come.</p>
          <p class="quoteSlug">Thank you for the opportunities you have given me!</p>

              <p>The PHPB seminar seeks to explore some of the humanistic issues related to patients, professions and the self. Our purpose is to recognize and encompass the concepts of basic dignity afforded to all we seek to care for. The seminar utilizes narratives, case studies, media, the arts, and guest speakers to examine the human story in its interaction with healthcare. The goal of this class is to provide insights into the perspectives of patients and providers as they relate to issues such as culture, hope, uncertainty, death and dying. Students will be invited to read, think, and create to expand their understanding of how social, medical and humanistic realities shape world views, relationships and decision making.</p>
