      <h2>Admission</h2>
      <p><b>Fall admission only.</b></p>
      <?php include("{$path}include/applyButton.php"); ?>
      <p>This is a highly selective and intense program. Each applicant is carefully reviewed taking into consideration the academic background, previous institutions, courses completed, GPAs earned, evaluations, and essays. The rigor and quality of the applicant's undergraduate and graduate curriculum is strongly considered as evidence of the ability to achieve the academic skills necessary for successful completion of PHPB.</p>
      <p><b>Applications are reviewed and evaluated on a rolling or first come, first served basis. All application materials must be received for admission to be finalized. The most competitive applicants will be admitted on a space available basis.</b></p>
      <p>Pursuing academic requirements alone is inadequate for application to healthcare professional graduate programs. This program requires students to participate in medically related service and research experiences. These positions are secured by the student. This program has no linkages with professional schools/programs and in no way guarantees admission.</p>

    <p class="squeezed">Students who took the pre-requisite science courses greater than five years ago.</p>
