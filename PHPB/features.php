      <p class="quoteSlug">As a Career Changer, the PHPB Program saved me precious time and resources. Instead of pursuing a second four-year Bachelors degree, the PHPB Program's curriculum allowed me to complete the necessary pre-requisites in two years. I can confidently say the program's rigor prepared me for the academic challenges of dental school. More importantly, the individual advising and mentorship I received helped me become a more desirable, well-rounded, and competitive applicant. Thank you PHPB for playing an instrumental role in helping me achieve my goal of attending the University of Florida College of Dentistry!</p>

            <p>The PHPB seminar seeks to explore some of the humanistic issues related to patients, professions and the self. Our purpose is to recognize and encompass the concepts of basic dignity afforded to all we seek to care for. The seminar utilizes narratives, case studies, media, the arts, and guest speakers to examine the human story in its interaction with healthcare. The goal of this class is to provide insights into the perspectives of patients and providers as they relate to issues such as culture, hope, uncertainty, death and dying. Students will be invited to read, think, and create to expand their understanding of how social, medical and humanistic realities shape world views, relationships and decision making.</p>
